For my hash function i took the numerical value of each
character then took the remainder when divided by the prime number closest
 to the total amount of characters (256) and added them together to get a total index
 value which i then divided by the length.

 I think this way works pretty well as my average value is around 2.5 or less for all of my files
 and i used a prime number because dividing by primes gives the most unique results in math.
